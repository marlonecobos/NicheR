## Description

In the real world, species occurrence data is rarely collected
systematically. It is usually heavily influenced by human
accessibility—researchers sample near roads, rivers, towns, or protected
areas. This is known as **Collection Bias** (or Observer Bias).

If a model is trained on biased data without accounting for it, the
model will predict *where the observers go*, rather than *where the
species actually lives*.

This vignette demonstrates how to use the `nicheR` package to simulate
this real-world phenomenon. We will draw occurrence points from a
prediction surface that has already been mathematically multiplied by a
bias layer (e.g., distance to roads), allowing us to see how
anthropogenic factors distort our view of the species’ niche.

  

## Getting ready

First, we load our core packages, the environmental background, and our
reference fundamental niche.

Instead of building a new prediction surface and applying bias manually,
we will load a pre-calculated raster (`applied_bias_rast.tif`) that
already contains our combined habitat suitability and sampling
probability.

``` r
# Load packages
library(nicheR)
library(terra)

# 1. Load environmental background
bios <- terra::rast(system.file("extdata", "ma_bios.tif", package = "nicheR"))
vars <- c("bio_1", "bio_12", "bio_15")

# 2. Load reference niche (nicheR_ellipsoid object)
data("example_sp_4", package = "nicheR")

# 3. Load the pre-calculated, bias-adjusted prediction surface
# This raster represents: (Habitat Suitability) * (Accessibility Bias)
pred_biased <- terra::rast(system.file("extdata", "applied_bias_rast.tif", package = "nicheR"))
```

  

## Basic generation with bias

The
[`sample_biased_data()`](https://castanedam.github.io/nicheR/reference/sample_biased_data.md)
function works similarly to standard sampling, but we point it toward
our bias-adjusted raster layer.

  

### Key Arguments

- **`n_occ`**: The total number of virtual occurrence points to
  generate.

- **`prediction`**: The spatial raster (`SpatRaster`) containing your
  geographic predictions. In this workflow, this raster has the
  collection bias already applied to it.

- **`prediction_layer`**: The exact name of the layer within your
  `prediction` raster to use for the sampling weights (e.g.,
  `"suitability_biased"`).

- **`strict`**: Logical. If `TRUE`, strictly forbids generating points
  in pixels that have a value of 0. If `FALSE`, allows a small
  probability for points to be generated in marginal habitats simulating
  mapping errors or sink populations.

- **`seed`**: Sets the random seed ensuring your generated points are
  exactly reproducible.

Once the spatial points (Longitude/Latitude) are generated, we must use
[`terra::extract()`](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/extract.html)
to pull the underlying climate values (Bio1, Bio12, Bio15) at those
specific coordinates so we can plot them in Environmental Space
(E-Space).

``` r
# Generate 100 occurrences from the biased suitability layer
occ_biased_xy <- sample_biased_data(
  n_occ = 100, 
  prediction = pred_biased, 
  prediction_layer = "suitability_biased_direct", 
  strict = FALSE,
  seed = 123
)
#> Starting: sample_biased_data()
#> Done: sampled 100 points from biased prediction layer

# Extract the environmental climate data at these physical coordinates
occ_biased <- terra::extract(bios, occ_biased_xy[, c("x", "y")])
env_biased <- terra::extract(bios, occ_biased_xy[, c("x", "y")])
```

  

### Visualizing spatial bias vs. collection bias

When we visualize biased occurrences, we are looking for the
“distortion” caused by human sampling effort. Let’s visualize this
side-by-side to see the geographic and environmental distortion
simultaneously.

``` r
par(mfrow = c(1, 3), mar = c(4, 4, 3, 2)) 

# Plot 1: G-Space (Map with biased suitability)
plot(pred_biased[["suitability_biased_direct"]], main = "G-Space: Biased Map", col = grDevices::terrain.colors(50))
points(occ_biased_xy[, c("x", "y")], pch = 20, col = "black", cex = 1.2)

# Plot 2: E-Space (Temperature vs Precipitation)
plot_ellipsoid(example_sp_4, background = as.data.frame(bios[[vars]]), dim = c(1, 2), pch = ".", col_bg = "#9a9797", 
               xlab = "Bio1 (Temp)", ylab = "Bio12 (Precip)", main = "E-Space: Biased Temp vs Precip")
add_data(occ_biased, x = "bio_1", y = "bio_12", pts_col = "orange", pch = 20)
add_data(as.data.frame(t(example_sp_4$centroid)), x = "bio_1", y = "bio_12", pts_col = "red", pch = 15, cex = 1.5)

# Plot 3: E-Space (Temperature vs Seasonality)
plot_ellipsoid(example_sp_4, background = as.data.frame(bios[[vars]]), dim = c(1, 3), pch = ".", col_bg = "#9a9797", 
               xlab = "Bio1 (Temp)", ylab = "Bio15 (Seasonality)", main = "E-Space: Biased Temp vs Season")
add_data(env_biased, x = "bio_1", y = "bio_15", pts_col = "orange", pch = 20)
add_data(as.data.frame(t(example_sp_4$centroid)), x = "bio_1", y = "bio_15", pts_col = "red", pch = 15, cex = 1.5)
```

**What to look for in the plots above:**

1.  **G-Space (The Map):** In an unbiased scenario, points cluster
    strictly in the most suitable (greenest) habitats. Here, notice how
    the points are forced into artificial geographic patterns (e.g.,
    linear clusters mimicking roads, or tight clumps near hypothetical
    towns), completely ignoring large swaths of highly suitable habitat
    simply because they are “hard to reach.”

2.  **E-Space (The Niche):** This is where the danger of bias becomes
    obvious. The red square is the optimal climate for the species. If
    sampling was unbiased, the orange dots would cluster around that red
    square. Instead, because observers only sampled accessible areas,
    the orange dots are dragged away from the optimal centroid and
    pushed into marginal, peripheral climates. If you trained a model on
    this data, the model would incorrectly assume the species prefers
    those marginal climates!

## Save and export

Because we generated standard spatial coordinates, we can export this
biased dataset for testing model robustness or for downstream spatial
analyses.

``` r
# Save the biased occurrence data frame to your local directory
# saveRDS(occ_biased, file = "data/biased_occurrences.rds")
```
