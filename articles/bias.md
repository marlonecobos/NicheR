## Description

Real-world biodiversity data is rarely collected systematically.
Biologists often sample near roads, rivers, or research stations,
creating spatial clustering that does not necessarily reflect optimal
habitat.

The `nicheR` package allows you to simulate these spatial sampling
biases. This workflow involves two steps:

1.  **[`prepare_bias()`](https://castanedam.github.io/nicheR/reference/prepare_bias.md)**:
    Standardizing raw environmental or anthropogenic covariates into
    probability-scaling surfaces.

2.  **[`apply_bias()`](https://castanedam.github.io/nicheR/reference/apply_bias.md)**:
    Mathematically fusing those bias surfaces with your habitat
    suitability predictions.

  

## Getting ready

First, we load the core packages required for our spatial and niche
operations. For this vignette, we assume you have already defined a
nicheR_ellipsoid object.

``` r
library(nicheR)
library(terra)

# 1. Load reference niche (nicheR_ellipsoid object)
data("ref_ellipse", package = "nicheR")

# 2. Load pre-calculated prediction surfaces (from previous vignettes)
# These SpatRasters contain "suitability", "Mahalanobis", "suitability_trunc", etc.
pred <- terra::rast(system.file("extdata", "predictions_rast.tif", package = "nicheR"))
pred_3d <- terra::rast(system.file("extdata", "predictions_3d_rast.tif", package = "nicheR"))
```

  

## Preparing the Bias Layer

Raw bias proxies (e.g., species richness, nighttime lights, distance to
roads) come in varying scales and units.
[`prepare_bias()`](https://castanedam.github.io/nicheR/reference/prepare_bias.md)
resamples, aligns, and min-max standardizes these layers to a strict
\[0, 1\] scale. If multiple layers are provided, it allows you to assign
unique directional effects to each before multiplying them into a single
composite surface.

``` r
# Load a sample bias layer containing 'sp_richness' and 'nighttime'
biases_file <- system.file("extdata", "ma_biases.tif", package = "nicheR")
raw_bias <- terra::rast(biases_file)

# --- Plotting the Output ---
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = c(4, 4, 3, 2))

# Plot the raw inputs
terra::plot(raw_bias[["sp_richness"]], main = "Species Richness")
terra::plot(raw_bias[["nighttime"]], main = "Nighttime Lights")
```

### Function Arguments

- **`bias_surface`**: A `SpatRaster` (single or multi-layer) or a list
  of `SpatRaster` objects representing your raw bias proxies.

- **`effect_direction`**: Character vector dictating how the raw values
  map to sampling probability:

  - `"direct"`: Higher raw values = higher sampling probability (kept as
    is).

  - `"inverse"`: Higher raw values = lower sampling probability
    (transformed to `1 - x`).

  - *Note: If providing a multi-layer raster, you can pass a vector of
    directions mapping to each respective layer.*

- **`template_layer`**: Optional `SpatRaster`. The reference layer used
  to align all bias layers (matching resolution, extent, and CRS). If
  `NULL`, the algorithm automatically selects the finest-resolution
  layer from your input.

- **`include_composite`**: Logical. If `TRUE` (default), the function
  outputs the combined, multiplied composite bias surface.

- **`include_processed_layers`**: Logical. If `TRUE`, includes the
  standardized individual layers *before* they are multiplied together.
  Default is `FALSE`.

- **`mask_na`**: Logical. Controls how `NA` (NoData) pixels are handled
  across multiple layers:

  - `TRUE` (Intersection): If a pixel is `NA` in *any* layer, the final
    composite pixel becomes `NA`.

  - `FALSE` (Union - default): Ignores `NA`s where other layers have
    valid values, preserving as much spatial coverage as possible.

- **`verbose`**: Logical. If `TRUE`, prints processing steps to the
  console.

  

### Example: Mixed-Direction Composite Bias

In this example, our `raw_bias` raster contains two layers:
`sp_richness` and `nighttime` (nighttime lights/urbanization).

Ecologically, sampling effort is likely highest in areas with known high
species richness, but lowest in highly urbanized areas. Therefore, we
will assign a `"direct"` effect to richness and an `"inverse"` effect to
nighttime lights to create a realistic composite bias surface.

``` r
# Prepare a composite bias surface mapping unique directions to each layer
prep_composite <- prepare_bias(bias_surface = raw_bias, 
                               effect_direction = c("direct", "inverse"), 
                               verbose = FALSE)
# Plot the resulting unified bias probability surface
terra::plot(prep_composite$composite_surface, main = "Composite Bias Surface")
```

![](bias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)

*Notice how the final composite surface creates “hotspots” for sampling
in areas that feature both high species richness AND low urbanization,
accurately reflecting the combined `effect_direction` parameter.*

  

## Applying Bias to Predictions

Once your bias surface is scaled between 0 and 1, you must integrate it
with your actual ecological prediction (e.g., habitat suitability).
[`apply_bias()`](https://castanedam.github.io/nicheR/reference/apply_bias.md)
aligns the grids and multiplies the suitability by the bias. **The
resulting output is a weighted surface, not a true biological
probability.**

  

### Function Arguments

- **`prepared_bias`**: A single-layer `SpatRaster`, or the list output
  generated by
  [`prepare_bias()`](https://castanedam.github.io/nicheR/reference/prepare_bias.md).

- **`prediction`**: A `SpatRaster` containing your suitability
  predictions. **Values must be within \[0, 1\]**.

- **`prediction_layer`**: Character. If your `prediction` raster has
  multiple layers, specify the exact name of the layer to use (e.g.,
  `"suitability"`). If `NULL`, it defaults to the first layer.

- **`effect_direction`**: Character. Dictates how the prepared bias is
  applied to the suitability:

  - `"direct"` (default): Multiplies suitability $\times$ bias.

  - `"inverse"`: Multiplies suitability
    $\times$$\left( 1 - \text{bias} \right)$.

- **`verbose`**: Logical. If `TRUE`, prints processing steps to the
  console.

  

### Example: Comparing Applied Biases

Below, we take a standard suitability prediction and restrict it using
the composite bias layer we just prepared. We will apply it as a
`"direct"` multiplier, meaning areas with high composite bias scores
will retain their suitability, while areas with low bias scores will be
penalized.

``` r
# Apply the composite bias to our suitability layer
applied_bias <- apply_bias(prepared_bias = prep_composite, 
                           prediction = pred, 
                           prediction_layer = "suitability",
                           effect_direction = "direct")
#> Starting: apply_bias()
#> Step: applying bias with 'direct' effect to to "suitability" layer...
#> Done: apply_bias(). Note: values are no longer probabilities

# --- Plotting the Output ---
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = c(4, 4, 3, 2))

# Original Biological Suitability
terra::plot(pred[["suitability"]], main = "Habitat Suitability")

# Suitability mathematically restricted by our composite sampling bias
terra::plot(applied_bias[[1]], main = "Suitability + Composite Bias")
```

![](bias_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)

*In the final comparison, observe how the spatial footprint of the
species shrinks based on the bias layer. When drawing points from the
`applied_bias` raster using
[`sample_biased_data()`](https://castanedam.github.io/nicheR/reference/sample_biased_data.md),
the algorithm is forced to ignore large swaths of highly suitable
habitat simply because the simulated sampling effort (driven by
nighttime lights and richness) in those areas is too low.*

### Three-Dimensional Example

Because collection bias is fundamentally geographic, the process of
applying it works identically regardless of how many environmental
dimensions were used to define the fundamental niche. Here, we apply the
exact same composite bias surface to our 3-dimensional species
prediction.

``` r
# Apply the composite bias to our 3D suitability layer
applied_bias_3d <- apply_bias(prepared_bias = prep_composite, 
                              prediction = pred_3d, 
                              prediction_layer = "suitability",
                              effect_direction = "direct")
#> Starting: apply_bias()
#> Step: applying bias with 'direct' effect to to "suitability" layer...
#> Done: apply_bias(). Note: values are no longer probabilities

# --- Plotting the Output ---
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = c(4, 4, 3, 2))

terra::plot(pred_3d[["suitability"]], main = "3D Habitat Suitability")
terra::plot(applied_bias_3d[[1]], main = "3D Suitability + Composite Bias")
```

## Save and export

``` r
# Save the final biased prediction layers to a temporary directory
temp_rast <- file.path(tempdir(), "applied_bias_rast.tif")
temp_rast_3d <- file.path(tempdir(), "applied_bias_3d_rast.tif")

terra::writeRaster(applied_bias[[1]], filename = temp_rast, overwrite = TRUE)
terra::writeRaster(applied_bias_3d[[1]], filename = temp_rast_3d, overwrite = TRUE)
```
