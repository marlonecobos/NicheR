# nicheR: An R package for elliposid-based niche construction

## Background

The field of distributional ecology is evolving rapidly, with new
algorithms, parameterization strategies, and hypotheses emerging at a
fast pace. Evaluating these ideas requires software that can isolate
mechanisms, account for bias, and clearly link ecological theory to
model behavior.

Virtual niche simulations help researchers test ideas by creating
controlled datasets that make model behavior easier to interpret. In
practice, building ellipsoid-based virtual niches in R has typically
required combining several packages to define niches, map them to
geography, and visualize results — making analyses harder to reproduce
and build on.

**nicheR** is an R package for building and visualizing
**ellipsoid-based ecological niches** using environmental data.

Inspired by the conceptual foundations of **NicheA** and the flexibility
of the **virtualspecies** package, **nicheR** provides a reproducible
framework that connects niche construction, prediction, sampling, and
visualization in one integrated workflow.

## Related work

Three tools have shaped virtual species and niche simulation in
ENM/SDMs:

- **NicheA** — a Java-based software that pioneered environmental-space
  niche visualization and explicitly linked niche theory with
  simulation. An important conceptual foundation for nicheR.
- **[virtualspecies](https://github.com/Farewe/virtualspecies)** — a
  widely adopted R package (200+ citations) for simulating virtual
  species and benchmarking SDMs and ENMs within R.
- **[evniche](https://github.com/marlonecobos/evniche/)** — a
  theoretically rigorous R package focused on environmental-space
  representations and ellipsoid-based niche concepts.

  

## Package description

**nicheR** operates across two complementary spaces:

- **E-space (Environmental Space)**: Ellipsoids represent multivariate
  environmental tolerances. This is where niches are defined,
  visualized, and compared.
- **G-space (Geographic Space)**: Predictions are projected across
  raster layers to map suitable geographic regions and generate virtual
  occurrence data.

This dual-space structure allows explicit separation between niche
definition, projection, and sampling processes, making it
straightforward to test ecological hypotheses under controlled,
reproducible conditions. The figure below shows a schematic view of how
the package works.

  

## Installing the package

Note: Internet connection is required to install the package.

The development version of nicheR can be installed using the code below.

``` r
# Installing and loading packages
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")

# To install the package use
devtools::install_github("castanedaM/nicheR")

# To install the package and its vignettes use (if needed use: force = TRUE)
devtools::install_github("castanedaM/nicheR", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

  

*Having problems?*

If you have any problems during installation, restart your R session,
close other RStudio sessions you may have open, and try again. If during
the installation you are asked to update packages, do so if you do not
need a specific version of one or more of the packages. If any package
gives an error when updating, install it alone using
[`install.packages()`](https://rdrr.io/r/utils/install.packages.html),
then try installing nicheR again.

  

To load the package use:

``` r
library(nicheR)
```

  

## Workflow in nicheR

A typical nicheR workflow follows these steps:

1.  **Build an ellipsoid** — define the niche from environmental ranges
2.  **Predict suitability** — project the ellipsoid onto raster or data
    frame inputs
3.  **Prepare bias layers** *(optional)* — define and apply sampling
    biases
4.  **Generate occurrences** — draw virtual occurrence records using
    various strategies
5.  **Simulate communities** *(optional)* — generate multi-species
    virtual communities

A brief description of each step is presented below. For complete
demonstrations, see the package vignettes listed in [Checking the
vignettes](#checking-the-vignettes).

  

### Building an ellipsoid

The ellipsoid is the core object in nicheR. It represents the virtual
species’ niche as a multivariate ellipse in environmental space, defined
by a centroid and a covariance matrix that determine its position, size,
and orientation. Ellipsoids are built from a range data frame specifying
the minimum and maximum for each environmental variable. nicheR computes
the centroid, covariance matrix, semi-axes lengths, and niche volume
automatically.

nicheR includes base-R plotting functions for visualizing ellipsoids in
E-space, both for individual dimension pairs and all pairwise
combinations at once. Adding the environmental background contextualizes
where the niche sits relative to available conditions.

> niche volume, and visualization options, see the [Building
> ellipsoids](https://castanedam.github.io/nicheR/articles/creating_ellipsoid_based_niches.html)
> vignette.

  

### Predicting suitability

Once the ellipsoid is built,
[`predict()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/predict.html) projects it onto
environmental data to produce Mahalanobis distance and suitability
surfaces. Suitability is highest at the niche centroid and decreases
toward the boundary. Truncated outputs set values to zero (suitability)
or `NA` (Mahalanobis) outside the ellipsoid, which is useful for
enforcing strict niche-boundary sampling downstream. Both `SpatRaster`
and `data.frame` inputs are supported and return matching output types.

> data frame workflows, and E-space vs. G-space visualization, see the
> [Predicting suitability and Mahalanobis
> distance](https://castanedam.github.io/nicheR/articles/predict.html)
> vignette.

  

### Preparing and applying bias layers

Bias layers represent external factors that influence sampling
detectability or effort, independent of the species’ actual niche. Each
layer is assigned a direction: `"direct"` means higher values increase
sampling probability, while `"inverse"` means higher values decrease it.
[`prepare_bias()`](https://castanedam.github.io/nicheR/reference/prepare_bias.md)
standardizes all layers to \[0, 1\], applies the directional
transformations, and combines them into a single composite bias surface.
[`apply_bias()`](https://castanedam.github.io/nicheR/reference/apply_bias.md)
then weights the suitability prediction by this surface to simulate
non-random, biased occurrence sampling.

> For details on bias surface construction, directional effects, and how
> bias interacts with predictions and sampling, see the [Sampling bias
> data](https://castanedam.github.io/nicheR/articles/sampling_bias_data.html)
> vignette.

  

### Generating virtual occurrences

nicheR provides two sampling functions:
[`sample_data()`](https://castanedam.github.io/nicheR/reference/sample_data.md)
for unbiased sampling directly from suitability or Mahalanobis surfaces,
and
[`sample_biased_data()`](https://castanedam.github.io/nicheR/reference/sample_biased_data.md)
for sampling from a bias-weighted prediction surface. Three sampling
strategies are available: `"centroid"` samples preferentially near the
niche center, `"edge"` samples near the boundary, and `"random"` samples
uniformly across the suitable area. Two weighting methods control
sampling probability: `"suitability"` weights by suitability score and
`"mahalanobis"` weights by distance from the centroid.

> vs. non-strict modes, and biased sampling workflows, see the [Sampling
> occurrence
> data](https://castanedam.github.io/nicheR/articles/sampling_occurrence_data.html)
> vignette.

  

### Simulating virtual communities

nicheR includes functions for simulating multi-species virtual
communities in environmental space. Three community types are available:
[`random_ellipses()`](https://castanedam.github.io/nicheR/reference/random_ellipses.md)
generates species with niches distributed randomly across E-space,
[`nested_ellipses()`](https://castanedam.github.io/nicheR/reference/nested_ellipses.md)
generates nested communities where each species niche is contained
within the previous one, and
[`conserved_ellipses()`](https://castanedam.github.io/nicheR/reference/conserved_ellipses.md)
generates communities where all species niches remain similar to a
reference niche, representing niche conservatism. Community predictions
produce presence-absence matrices and species richness maps that can be
used to explore macroecological patterns.

> For a full demonstration of community simulation, prediction, and
> richness mapping, see the [Virtual community
> simulation](https://castanedam.github.io/nicheR/articles/virtual_communities.html)
> vignette.

  

### Visualization

nicheR includes a set of plotting functions for visualizing ellipsoids,
predictions, and occurrence data in E-space.
[`plot_ellipsoid()`](https://castanedam.github.io/nicheR/reference/plot_ellipsoid.md)
opens a new E-space plot,
[`add_data()`](https://castanedam.github.io/nicheR/reference/add_data.md)
overlays points colored by a continuous variable,
[`add_ellipsoid()`](https://castanedam.github.io/nicheR/reference/add_ellipsoid.md)
overlays an ellipsoid boundary, and
[`plot_ellipsoid_pairs()`](https://castanedam.github.io/nicheR/reference/plot_ellipsoid_pairs.md)
produces multi-panel pairwise projections with globally consistent axis
limits.

> space](https://castanedam.github.io/nicheR/articles/plotting_vignette.html)
