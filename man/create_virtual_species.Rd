\item{...}{Named arguments passed to the component functions.

\itemize{
  \item \strong{build_ellps()}: e.g. `center`, `axes`, `angles`, etc.

\item{out.file}{Logical. If `TRUE`, save the returned object to an `.rds`
file in the working directory.}

\value{
A list of class **NicheR_species** with elements:
\itemize{
  \item \code{niche}: the ellipsoid object returned by [build_ellps()].
  \item \code{suitability}: suitability object from [get_suitable_env()].
  \item \code{bias_surface}: either `NULL`, a \code{nicheR_bias_surface}
        object (if [set_bias_surface()] was used), or a user-supplied
        single-layer bias raster.
  \item \code{occurrences}: sampled occurrences from [get_sample_occ()].
  \item \code{call_args}: the original `...` captured as a named list.
  \item \code{routed_args}: a list showing which args went to each function.
  \item \code{save_path}: file path if \code{out.file = TRUE}, otherwise `NULL`.
}
}
\description{
Orchestrates the full NicheR workflow by routing `...` to
[build_ellps()], [get_suitable_env()], optionally [set_bias_surface()],
and [get_sample_occ()]. Returns an S3 object of class **NicheR_species**
containing the niche object, suitability, (optional) bias surface, and
sampled occurrences.
}
\details{
If `env_bg` is supplied only at the top level, it is forwarded to both
[get_suitable_env()] and [get_sample_occ()] (if those functions accept an
`env_bg` argument). If a required argument (such as `env_bg`) is missing
for a component, the function stops with an informative error.

When available in [get_suitable_env()]'s formals and not explicitly set
by the user, `create_virtual_species()` sets:
\itemize{
  \item `out.suit = "both"` so that both raster and data.frame outputs are
        available for plotting and downstream use.
  \item `distances = TRUE` so that distance-to-centroid information is
        computed and can be used in geographic plots.
}

If [get_sample_occ()] has a `suitable_env` argument and the user does not
supply it, the suitability object returned by [get_suitable_env()] is
automatically forwarded as `suitable_env`.

\strong{Bias handling:}
\itemize{
  \item If the user passes only `bias_surface` (and no additional
        [set_bias_surface()] arguments), it is assumed to be a
        \emph{precomputed single-layer raster} scaled to \eqn{[0, 1]} and
        is passed directly to [get_sample_occ()] (which expects a 0–1 layer).
  \item If the user passes `bias_surface` \emph{plus} any
        [set_bias_surface()] arguments (e.g. `bias_dir`, `suitable_env`,
        `out.bias`), then [set_bias_surface()] is called once, and its
        pooled bias raster is passed to [get_sample_occ()] as
        `bias_surface`. The full bias object is stored in the output
        as `bias_surface`.
  \item When [set_bias_surface()] is invoked and `suitable_env` is not
        provided to it explicitly, the suitability object from
        [get_suitable_env()] is used as the mask/template.

\section{Workflow}{

1. Calls [build_ellps()] to define the ellipsoid in E-space.
2. Calls [get_suitable_env()] to compute suitability in G-space.
3. Optionally calls [set_bias_surface()] to build a pooled bias raster
   when bias-construction arguments are supplied (e.g., `bias_surface`,
   `bias_dir`, `suitable_env`, `out.bias`).
4. Calls [get_sample_occ()] to sample occurrences from the suitable
   (and optionally biased) environment.
