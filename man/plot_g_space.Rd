\usage{
plot_g_space(
  env_bg,
  n_bg = 10000,
  niche = NULL,
  show.suitable = FALSE,
  show.distance = FALSE,
  occ_pts = NULL,
  show.occ.density = FALSE,
  colors = NULL,
  palette = "default"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{env_bg}{A background environment object used by
[get_suitable_env()]. Typically a `terra::SpatRaster` (or `raster::Raster*`)
providing the environmental layers and extent.}

\item{n_bg}{Integer (currently unused; reserved for future downsampling of
the background grid).}

\item{niche}{Optional object of class `"ellipsoid"` (from [build_ellps()]).
Required when `show.suitable = TRUE` or `show.distance = TRUE`.}

\item{show.suitable}{Logical. If `TRUE`, fills suitable environments
(inside the ellipsoid) as tiles.}

\item{show.distance}{Logical. If `TRUE`, fills tiles by squared distance to
the ellipsoid centroid (`dist_sq`). If both flags are `TRUE`, distance is
turned off and suitability is shown (with a message).}

\item{occ_pts}{Optional `data.frame` of occurrences with columns `x`, `y`
(assumed longitude/latitude, WGS84). Plotted as points if supplied.}

\item{show.occ.density}{Logical (currently unused; reserved for future
density panels).}

\item{colors}{Optional named list to override aesthetics. Recognized names:
`bg` (basemap fill), `suitable_env` (suitable tiles), `occ_fill`,
`occ_stroke`, and `dist` (RColorBrewer palette name for distance tiles).
Example: `list(suitable_env = "#66CC99", dist = "YlOrRd")`.}

\item{palette}{Character palette key (currently `"default"`; reserved for
future sets).}
}
\value{
A `ggpubr` object produced by [ggpubr::ggarrange()], containing the
  map panel and a matching legend panel.
}
\description{
Draws a world basemap and overlays (a) suitable environments as tiles
derived from a niche ellipsoid, (b) a continuous distance-to-centroid
surface, and/or (c) occurrence points. A compact custom legend is built
to match the layers shown. If both `show.suitable` and `show.distance`
are `TRUE`, the function disables `show.distance` and proceeds with
`show.suitable = TRUE`.
}
\details{
The suitability/distance surface is obtained via
`get_suitable_env(niche, env_bg, out = "data.frame", distances = TRUE)`,
which returns columns `x`, `y`, and `dist_sq`. When `show.distance = TRUE`,
a continuous legend is provided by `scale_fill_distiller()`. The custom
legend on the right reflects only the discrete layers actually drawn
(background, suitable, occurrences).
}
\section{Notes}{

- `niche` must be provided if either `show.suitable` or `show.distance` is `TRUE`.
- If both `show.suitable` and `show.distance` are `TRUE`, the function sets
  `show.distance <- FALSE` and informs the user.
- `occ_pts` must include columns named `x` and `y`.
