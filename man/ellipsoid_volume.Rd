\usage{
ellipsoid_volume(n_dimensions, semi_axes_length)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_dimensions}{Integer. Number of dimensions (\eqn{p}).}

\item{semi_axes_length}{Numeric vector of length \code{n_dimensions}
containing the ellipsoid semi-axis lengths.}
}
\value{
Numeric. Geometric volume of the ellipsoid.
}
\description{
Calculates the geometric volume (or area in 2D) of a p-dimensional ellipsoid
defined by its semi-axis lengths.
}
\details{
For an ellipsoid with semi-axes \eqn{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_p}, the volume is:

\deqn{
V_p = V_{\text{n},p} \prod_{i=1}^{p} a_i
}

where the volume of the p-dimensional n is:

\deqn{
V_{\text{n},p} =
\frac{\pi^{p/2}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{p}{2} + 1\right)}
}

In the context of probabilistic niche modeling, the semi-axis lengths are
typically defined as:

\deqn{
a_i = \sqrt{\lambda_i \, c^2}
}

where:
\itemize{
  \item \eqn{\lambda_i} are the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix
  \eqn{\Sigma}
  \item \eqn{c^2 = \chi^2_p(\text{level})} is the chi-square cutoff defining the
  probability contour
}

This formulation allows ellipsoid volume to be computed directly from either
covariance matrices or axis lengths derived from them.


\strong{Interpretation:}

\itemize{
  \item In 2D, the returned value is area.
  \item In 3D, the returned value is volume.
  \item In higher dimensions, the result is a hypervolume measured in the
    product of environmental units.
}

The volume depends on the selected probability contour (\code{level}) and
therefore increases monotonically with increasing \code{level}.
