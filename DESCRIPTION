Description: Provides a robust set of tools for researchers and modelers to
    construct and define virtual ecological niches using ellipsoid geometries.
    It enables the identification and extraction of suitable environmental
    areas, simulation of species occurrence points with various sampling
    strategies, and visualization of niche boundaries and simulated occurrences
    in both environmental and geographic space. Inspired by methodologies in
    NicheA and the virtualspecies R package, NicheR aims to streamline the
    process of niche conceptualization and data generation for ecological studies.
